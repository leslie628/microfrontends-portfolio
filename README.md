# Microfrontend Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Microfrontend Projects collection! This repository serves as a centralized showcase for all my microfrontend repositories.

## Projects

### 1. [Dashboard shell Microfrontend](https://github.com/leslie628/dashboard-shell)  
Dashboard shell micro app which orchestrates its own child micro apps. The purpose of this is to facilitate flexibility in the future addition of new features as new micro apps, as the dashboard shell evolves. The dashboard shell will register the micro apps dynamically, but the micro apps will be added to the shell app import maps. Therefore, there is no need to redeploy the dashboard shell microapp to reflect new child micro apps, as these can be added directly from the root app.

### 2. [Dashboard Microfrontend](https://github.com/leslie628/dashboard-app)  
Main user dashboard.

### 3. [Settings Microfrontend](https://github.com/leslie628/settings-app)  
Settings micro app.

### 4. [User profile Microfrontend](https://github.com/leslie628/user-profile)  
User profile micro app.

## Overview

Each microfrontend is developed as an independent repository to allow modular development, easy deployment, and seamless integration using microfrontend architecture principles.
